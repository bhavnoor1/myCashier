Welcome to MyCashier 


A simple point of sale application originally created as a proof of concept for a school class, later utilized by the cafeteria at our highschool!


The program can be modified to meet any clients needs, it should be noted that this was the first large programming project for all three of us, the documentation may be lacking however the program was noted to be fully functional
